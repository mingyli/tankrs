# Tankrs Client

Written in typescript. To build and run app:

1. Run build in the client directory: `make all`
2. Open `app/app.html` in your browser of choice.

`make all` recompiles the schema and compiles the typescript. Other options include:

- `make schema`: just recompiles the schema. This is necessary if schema changes are made.
- `make dev`: typechecks and compiles the typescript.
